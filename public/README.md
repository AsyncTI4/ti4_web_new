# Images

Images are stored in two places:

1) Here, in this very repo

2) If an image is being fetching from the `cdnImage()` function, it is a cdn mirror of the assets available at https://github.com/AsyncTI4/TI4_map_generator_bot/tree/master/src/main/resources. There is currently a manual process required to move from that repo to the cdn mirror for this repo - if you find an inconsistency, please reach out to get that process sorted out!
